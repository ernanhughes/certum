difficulty:
  # Difficulty index is a normalized policy construct, not a learned variable.
  # Each component ∈ [0,1]; weights sum to 1.0 (equal-order prior).

  weights:
    evidence_sparsity: 0.25        # Few evidence atoms → high difficulty
    rank_collapse:     0.25        # Low effective rank → weak structure
    sensitivity:       0.20        # Brittleness under leave-one-out
    robustness:        0.15        # Instability under parameter variation
    hard_negative_gap: 0.15        # Adversarial regime indicator

  thresholds:
    low:  0.40   # Below this, problem considered structurally easy
    high: 0.75   # Above this, problem considered intrinsically hard

policy:
  # Energy-relative margins are expressed as fractions of tau
  margin_fraction: 0.10

    min_accept: 0.25
    min_review: 0.05
